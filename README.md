# Facial Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based facial emotion detection system that classifies facial expressions into one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled facial image data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time emotion detection from images
- Predicts 7 emotions with good accuracy
- Visualization of performance using confusion matrix and accuracy/loss graphs
- Model trained using TensorFlow/Keras

## ðŸ”§ Libraries Required

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- keras
- scikit-learn
